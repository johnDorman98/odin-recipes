    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      French onion soup, also known as soupe à l'oignon gratinée, is a timeless
      French favourite made with deeply caramelised onions simmered in a rich
      beef stock or broth. It's traditionally topped with crusty bread and
      melted cheese, then baked until golden and bubbling. Often served in a
      ramekin or handled ceramic crock, this comforting dish is both rustic and
      indulgent.

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Melt butter with olive oil in an 8-quart stock pot over medium heat. Add
        onions to butter and continually stir until tender and translucent. Do
        not brown the onions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add beef broth, sherry, and thyme. Season with salt and pepper. Let
        simmer for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven's broiler.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ladle soup into oven-safe serving bowls and place one slice of bread on
        top of each (bread may be broken into pieces if you prefer). Layer each
        slice of bread with a slice of provolone, 1/2 slice diced Swiss and 1
        tablespoon Parmesan cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place bowls on a cookie sheet and broil in the preheated oven until
        cheese bubbles and browns slightly, 2 to 3 minutes.

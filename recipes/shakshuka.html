    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat olive oil in a large sauté pan on medium heat. Add the chopped bell
        pepper and onion and cook for 5 minutes or until the onion becomes
        translucent.
      </li>
      <li>Add garlic and spices and cook an additional minute.</li>
      <li>
        Pour the can of tomatoes and juice into the pan and break down the
        tomatoes using a large spoon. Season with salt and pepper and bring the
        sauce to a simmer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use your large spoon to make small wells in the sauce and crack the eggs
        into each well. Cook the eggs for 5 to 8 minutes, or until the eggs are
        done to your liking. You can also cover the pan with a lid to expedite
        the eggs cooking.

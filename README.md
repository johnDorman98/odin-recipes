# Recipe Project

## Description

This project is a multi-page website built with HTML to showcase some of my favourite recipes. It serves as a personal recipe collection—featuring meals I’ve tried, plan to try, or have modified to create custom versions. The site functions as both a reference and a space for experimentation.

## Skills Demonstrated

The project demonstrates my grasp of core HTML concepts, including:

- Using the paragraph (`<p>`) element to properly format text content
- Creating structured content with unordered (`<ul>`) and ordered (`<ol>`) lists for ingredients and steps
- Linking images and pages using relative file paths
- Implementing internal navigation with the `<a>` (anchor) element to connect multiple HTML pages

Additionally, I used Git for version control, maintaining a clear and consistent commit history to reflect good development practices and workflow discipline.

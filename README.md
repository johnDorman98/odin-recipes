# Recipe Project

## Description

This project is a multi-page website built with HTML to showcase some of my favourite recipes. It's a personal recipe collection featuring meals Iâ€™ve tried, plan to try, or have modified to create my own versions. The site serves as both a reference point and a space for experimentation.

## Skills Demonstrated

The project demonstrates my grasp of core HTML concepts, including:

- Using the paragraph (`<p>`) element to properly format text content
- Creating structured content with unordered (`<ul>`) and ordered (`<ol>`) list elements for ingredients and steps
- Linking images and pages using relative file paths
- Adding images using the image (`<img>`) element
- Implementing internal navigation with the `<a>` (anchor) element to connect multiple HTML pages

Additionally, I used Git for version control, maintaining a clear and consistent commit history to reflect good development practices and workflow discipline.
